# webdev-basics
Expect all of this to be very basic stuff with probably quite a few mistakes, I've only just started web development!

But feel free to take a look around anyways.

### Now with:
* Basic Tags
* Tag Attributes
* Some very basic webpage examples
* Borders & Border Radii (In CSS of course)
* The CSS display property

### Next I'll be working on...

#### ...more CSS.
